# Analysis pipelines for the [GTEx Consortium](www.gtexportal.org) and [TOPMed](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/science/trans-omics-precision-medicine-topmed-program)

This repository contains analysis pipelines for:

* RNA-seq alignment, quantification, and quality control
* eQTL mapping and annotation
* Allele-specific expression quantification
* Generation of the collapsed annotation used for gene-level expression quantification

Pipeline components are available as docker images, and execution scripts are provided in [WDL](https://github.com/broadinstitute/wdl). The pipelines are available on [FireCloud](http://firecloud.org), in the namespace *broadinstitute_gtex*.
